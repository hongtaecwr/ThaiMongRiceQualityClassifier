# Convolutional Network Model for Quality Classification of ข้าวเหนียวดำม้ง in Thailand

Welcome to the repository for a convolutional network model designed for classifying the quality of "ข้าวเหนียวดำม้ง" (Black Glutinous Rice) in Thailand. This model is trained to accurately categorize different quality aspects of the rice, providing a valuable tool for quality assessment in the agricultural sector.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset to achieve high accuracy in classifying various quality parameters of ข้าวเหนียวดำม้ง.
- **Easy Integration:** Users can seamlessly integrate this model into their applications, programs, or tools for quality assessment purposes.
- **Open Source:** This project is open source, allowing users to not only utilize the model but also contribute to its improvement.

## Usage

### 1.Integration into Applications

```python
# Example code snippet for using the model in a Python application
from quality_classifier import QualityClassifier

# Load the model
model = QualityClassifier()

# Use the model for quality classification
result = model.classify_quality(image_path='path/to/your/image.jpg')
print(result)
```

### 2.Adaptation for Various Tools

```
// Example code snippet for using the model in a Java program
QualityClassifier model = new QualityClassifier();

// Load the model
model.loadModel();

// Use the model for quality classification
String result = model.classifyQuality("path/to/your/image.jpg");
System.out.println(result);

```

### 3.Adaptation for Various Tools:
The model can be easily adapted for use in different tools, providing a flexible solution for quality assessment tasks.
